# Prompt Engineering Techniques

This repository combines **Hugging Face** and **LlamaIndex** to handle NLP tasks and advanced data querying.

## Overview

**Hugging Face**
Hugging Face is a leading open-source platform for NLP, providing pre-trained models, datasets, and tools to make it easy to implement and fine-tune transformers and other models for a wide range of NLP tasks.

This project uses Hugging Face for:
- **Transformer Models**: Pre-trained transformer models for various NLP tasks.
- **Pipeline API:** Easy-to-use pipeline API for quick model inference.
- **Dataset Management:** Access to datasets for training and fine-tuning models if required.

**LlamaIndex**
LlamaIndex (formerly GPT Index) is a data indexing and retrieval framework optimized for large language models (LLMs). It structures unstructured data for effective querying by LLMs, making it ideal for applications that need to process large amounts of context-sensitive data.

This project uses LlamaIndex for:

- **Data Indexing:** Structuring data into a format suitable for retrieval by large language models.
- **Efficient Querying:** Allowing complex queries against the indexed data, improving LLM response quality.
- **Knowledge Retrieval:** Enabling knowledge-based responses by supplying the LLM with relevant context.

## Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone git clone git@github.com:StevenMcGown/prompt-engineering.git
cd prompt-engineering
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Quick Start

### Hugging Face Example

```python
from transformers import pipeline

classifier = pipeline("sentiment-analysis")
print(classifier("This is an amazing tool!"))
```

### LlamaIndex Example

```python
from llama_index import LlamaIndex

index = LlamaIndex("path/to/your/data")
response = index.query("What are the key benefits?")
print(response)
```
